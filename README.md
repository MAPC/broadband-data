## Measurement Lab (M-Lab) Data

>Measurement Lab (M-Lab) provides the largest collection of open Internet performance data on the planet. As a consortium of research, industry, and public-interest partners, M-Lab is dedicated to providing an ecosystem for the open, verifiable measurement of global network performance.

We have used M-Lab data in Dec 2020 [DataCommon visulization](https://datacommon.mapc.org/calendar/2020/december). The full data is available on [Google BigQuery here](https://www.measurementlab.net/data/). Accessing this data requires creating a free an account, more info [here](https://www.measurementlab.net/data/docs/bq/quickstart/) You can contribute to the dataset through the google widget or with a test [here](https://speed.measurementlab.net/#/). 

Notes about the Mlab data. Mlab speed tests, often captured through the Google widget that appears when speed test is searched, is a method of measuring a network by sending a web packet to a server and back. While not illustrative of all ways user may experience speed it is openly available data generated by users across various geographies and captured at lat/long level. As of 2020 Mlab community suggest not aggregating test data below the municipal level as the geo info derived from testing is not yet considered reliable at lower geographies like tract. More into on how geography is captured in tests [here](https://www.measurementlab.net/blog/evolution-of-annotations/)

Our initial data pull for a few towns can be found in this repository [here](https://github.com/MAPC/broadband-data/tree/main/data). The scripts we used are also in that [here](https://github.com/MAPC/broadband-data/tree/main/processors). The by provider, by year for three communities we are working with can be [found here](https://airtable.com/shr4YlB9Ps9MM8qCw).

In spring of 2021 MAPC worked with the BU Spark class CS506 to collect and analyze speed test data. Team 1 focused on Mlab and Ookla while Team 2 focused on FCC data. The output of Team 1 Mlab work can be found [here](https://github.com/BU-Spark/CS506Spring2021Repository/tree/master/mapc2). 


## Ookla Data
>Speedtest Intelligence offers up-to-date insights into global fixed broadband and mobile performance data based on millions of consumer-initiated tests taken every day with Speedtest®.

Ookla offers a variety of network services and data products. In 2020 Ookla made open and publicly available some of it's aggregated data,[Ookla Open Data Annoucement](https://www.speedtest.net/insights/blog/announcing-ookla-open-datasets/). The data is available in grids that cross census boundaries like blocks and tracts.
Ookla data from Spring 2021 BU Spark class work can be found [here](https://github.com/BU-Spark/CS506Spring2021Repository/tree/master/mapc2/data). 
[Ookla Fixed and Mobile Network Performance Maps](https://registry.opendata.aws/speedtest-global-performance/)
Georgia partnered with Ookla to create [broadband availability maps](https://broadband.georgia.gov/maps)


## Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Data
>Sometimes referred to as form 477 data as facilities-based broadband providers in US are required to file data with the FCC twice a year through a form call Form 477. Providers file lists of census blocks in which they can or do offer service to at least one location. 

FCC data and resources can be [found here](https://www.fcc.gov/general/broadband-deployment-data-fcc-form-477) and [or found here](https://opendata.fcc.gov/). In our 2020 analysis with BU we used a down of the FCC which can be found here [MA-Fixed-Jun2019](https://github.com/MAPC/broadband-data-bu/tree/main/FCC%20data) and in the BU team's repo [here](https://github.com/BU-Spark/CS506Spring2021Repository/tree/master/MAPC_Team_1)

## Microsoft Data
>Microsoft published an open dataset in May of 2021. “The data can be used for the purpose of analyzing, understanding, improving, or addressing problems related to broadband access….
The data from these services are combined with the number of households per county and zip code[1]. Every time a device receives an update or connects to a Microsoft service, we can estimate the throughput speed of a machine. We know the size of the package sent to the computer, and we know the total time of the download. We also determine zip code level location data via reverse IP.”

We have used this data in developing Everett, Chelsea, Revere Digital Access reports to supplement Ookla and Mlab data in these municipalities and illustrate similar amounts of user not experiencing 25/3 broadband speeds.

## DataCommon and Census Data
There are many datasets available for the Census that may prove interesting for further analysis in this project. You can browse and download Census data for Massachusetts on [DataCommon](https://datacommon.mapc.org/browser) or the full list on [Data.Census](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). Visualization to note on DataCommon a map looking at the Census question "Households without a computing device": [The Digital Divide and the 2020 Census](https://datacommon.mapc.org/calendar/2020/april).

## MAPC Community Survey:
In Summer of 2021 MAPC in partnership with Everett Chelsea and Revere and local CBOs conducted a broadband survey with over 2,000 responses through Qualtrics. Data will be made available with forthcoming Digital Access Reports.

###_Potential Data Source: _Education Superhighway Bridge to Broadband 
Pilot ongoing in 10 MA school districts to negotiate a secure data transfer between school district and internet services providers to identify for students in a school district three data points are they served by a provider, could they be served , not currently able to be served at that residence. More into about that program [here](https://www.educationsuperhighway.org/bridge-to-broadband/)

### _Potential Data Source:_ Cable Franchise Agreements
Cable television [franchise agreements]( https://www.mass.gov/lists/cable-television-licenses), managed at the municipal level have similar clauses that require companies to share with municipalities map of assets. Often section 4.12, subsections (a) and (b) of the Municipal Franchise Agreements 


### _Potential Data Source:_ Form 500 Data
Department of Telecommunications and Cable collect [form 500]( https://www.mass.gov/doc/paper-filing-instructions/download) documents that cable tv complaints submitted by residents.

###_Potential Data Source:_ Better business Bureau and Review Sties
[Better Business Bureau]( https://www.bbb.org/) complaint data 

### _Potential Data Source:_ Zoom / Google Classroom Diagnostic Data
We believe there is potential to leverage the data created by the expanded use of Zoom and Google Classroom. More info can be [found here](Broadband School Zoom-Google Data.docx)

### _Potential Data Source: _Municipal Raspberry Pi Wi-Fi Mapping
